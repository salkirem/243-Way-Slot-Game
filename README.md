    "Wild Whirlwind Slots" is a 243-way game featuring 12 symbols, including 10 regular symbols, 1 scatter symbol, and 1 WILD symbol.
    The scatter symbol triggers scatter payouts.
    The WILD symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5 during both the base game and free games.
    A nudged WILD can appear in the middle reel during the base game, adding excitement and opportunities for bigger wins.

    Free Game RTP: 26%

Free Game Features:

    Free games can be triggered and retriggered by the scatter symbol.
    A maximum of 120 free spins can be rewarded per set of free games. If a player accumulates more than 120 free spins, additional spins beyond this limit will not be awarded, but scatter payouts will still occur.
    In the free game, a unique multiplier feature enhances the excitement. If a spin results in a payout, the next spin's payout will be multiplied by a multiplier.
    The multiplier starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each successive payout spin.
    The maximum multiplier value is 20.
    If a spin does not result in a payout, the multiplier count resets to 1.

Volatility Calculation:

The volatility of the base game is determined by running simulations to assess the variance in payouts across 2 million rounds. This calculation considers the frequency and size of wins to classify the game's volatility as low, medium, or high.
